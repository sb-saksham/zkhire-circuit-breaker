zkHire - A zero-knowledge hiring platform where job seekers secure positions solely based on their skills, eliminating biases associated with referrals. Recruiters gain access to a diverse pool of talent with specific skill sets for various tasks. All company and job data are securely stored on a smart contract deployed on the L2 Scroll Chain. Recruiters can effortlessly post jobs, and users can apply for them. The assessment process offers three options: quiz-type evaluations with technical questions and answers, coding tests featuring a single coding challenge, or a comprehensive test combining both quiz and coding elements. Post-assessment, users generate a zero-knowledge proof showcasing their achievement of the required marks and successful completion of the coding test. This proof is securely stored on the smart contract. Recruiters receive notifications that the user has completed the test and can verify it using the proof, obtaining confirmation without knowledge of specific scores. With this streamlined process, recruiters can seamlessly proceed with further hiring steps, allowing candidates to participate in tests free from discrimination and bias. Here, merit is the key, and individuals merely need to demonstrate their capabilities to secure employment.
